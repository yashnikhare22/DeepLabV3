Overview
This project demonstrates panoramic image segmentation using the DeepLabv3 architecture on the CityScape dataset. Panoramic segmentation involves understanding and labeling objects in panoramic images, which can be applied to various applications like autonomous driving, urban planning, and more.

Features
Panopatic segmentation of images.
DeepLabv3 model with MobileNetV2 backbone.
Evaluation of model performance using CityScape dataset.
Pre-trained model weights for quick experimentation.

Usage
Follow these steps to use the project:

Download the CityScape dataset.

Preprocess the dataset and organize it into the desired directory structure.

Train the DeepLabv3 model using the provided code.

Evaluate the model's performance on the CityScape validation dataset.


Dataset
The CityScape dataset is used for training and evaluation. Download and preprocess the dataset according to your requirements. You can adjust the data loading pipeline in the code to fit your dataset structure.
